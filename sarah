Verse 1:
Sarah, she's a little firecracker
Smart as a whip and twice as quick
But when she doesn't get her way
She'll fuss and pout the whole day through

Chorus:
She's a beautiful, sneaky, spoilt little thing
Never content, always asking for more
But when it's movie night, she lights up like a spark
Sarah, my little princess, I love her to the moon and back

Verse 2:
Sometimes she drives me up the wall
But I can't stay mad, she's just too darn cute
She's got a heart of gold and a smile that could light up a room
I'm so lucky to call her mine

Chorus:
She's a beautiful, sneaky, spoilt little thing
Never content, always asking for more
But when it's movie night, she lights up like a spark
Sarah, my little princess, I love her to the moon and back
